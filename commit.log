Descr1 and Descr2 replaced by Descr, a slightly modified Descr2. Both processes were simply different formulations of the same physics. Descr simply makes Descr2 easier to read. Descr2 was chosen to fit with the other non-thermal desorption mechanisms, all taken from Roberts 2007.

Minor analysis updates

dstep/points treatment updated. Av calculated from edge in, dstep counted from core out.
Alterations to Felix collapse and Zainab temperature to account for multipoint codes updating tage after first point.

Users now only input Vs and initial density. Tsat and Tn,max calculated from polynomial fits to Jimenez-Serra 2008 (Table 5) and Drain 1983 (Figs 8 & 9), checked against grid of models run for Viti 2011.
