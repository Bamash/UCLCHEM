knrco/h2d are wrong
	they use column densities that are never calculated and chtot which is calculated after it is 
	used.

Freeze out
	Beta=1 for ions. Alpha is set as an 'efficiency' basically setting the fraction of a species
	that freezes down a particular route. Beta and gamma are then set to zero as they are useless.
	However, beta is set to 1 for ions so that ucl_chem can pick out the ions and freeze them out 
	differently.

Zeros
	rate(j)=1.0d-30 when it is really zero. This was to avoid computing issues. However, in many cases a modern fortran code on a modern pc will run without errors. Investigate this.
