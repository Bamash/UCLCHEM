# UCL_CHEM
UCLCHEM is a time dependent gas-grain chemical code written in Fortran 95. It propagates the abundances of chemical species through a network of user-defined reactions according to the physical conditions of the gas. Included in the repository is MakeRates, a python script to combine a species list, UMIST reaction file and user-define reaction file into a consistent network with all files required by UCLCHEM.
